# NewUnityProject
Android video game that uses voice commands made with Unity

the purpose of this prototype is to seek collaborations to create open source video games that can be used as an aid for preschool children with language problems.
Proposals and collaborations are welcome in order both to improve the prototype and to create additional material enriched with illustrations, animations, music and anything else useful.
The videogame prototype presented is about learning the concepts of left, right, jump, big and small.
Subsequently, I propose, possibly expanding the prototype presented, to start making video games for the following constructs:
1) and;
2) with;
3) without;
4) Also;
5) or;
6) of;
7) to / from;
8) below / above;
9) in (inside) / out
10) between;
11) front / back;
12) near / far;
13) against;
14) same / different;
15) bigger / smaller / equal;
16) singular / plural
17) before / after;
18) cause / effect
19) verbs
20) construction of periods
21) relative pronoun that,
22) etc.
